# Global Master Task
## Introduction
This is a recruitment task for globalmaster.eu, which was dedicated for making a part of a website https://www.hydraulic-master.com/ by using only pure HTML and CSS.
## How did I approach the task
To solve the assigned problem, I had to first analyze given internet page by using Developer Tools in my browser, particularly the Selection Tool. When I was sure which elements were included into the part of the website I was supposed to recreate, I began to write it, starting with the company's banner, then navigation panel, and finishing with categories widgets.  Because of using grid for widgets, created website works on different-sized devices. All of the images and basic colors were taken from the original website.
## Used technologies
To complete the task, I used Visual Studio Code as a text editor. Code was written only in HTML/CSS, including font library from https://fonts.google.com/.
## Launch process
To launch the website:
1. Clone the repository or download all the files as ZIP and unpack them.
2. Open the file index.html by double clicking on it (or right-click, open with and choose a browser).
